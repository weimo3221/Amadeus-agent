# Implementation Notes

## Current Build Direction

The project started as a TypeScript monorepo for fast Electron iteration, but the runtime direction is now Python-first:

- Electron + Vite for `apps/desktop`
- Node.js WebSocket bridge for `apps/server`
- Python runtime under `packages/amadeus`
- shared event types from `packages/amadeus/events.ts`

`apps/desktop` should remain a UI/device adapter. `apps/server` should remain a transport bridge. Agent, memory, model adapters, tools, skills, and audio planning should move into `packages/amadeus` behind narrow HTTP/event APIs.

## AIRI Code to Study First

When implementation starts, inspect these paths:

- `../airi/apps/stage-tamagotchi/src`
- `../airi/apps/stage-tamagotchi/electron.vite.config.ts`
- `../airi/packages/stage-ui-live2d/src`
- `../airi/packages/core-character/src`
- `../airi/packages/core-agent/src`
- `../airi/packages/model-driver-lipsync/src`

Do not copy the whole project. Pull over only the specific patterns needed for the MVP.

## MVP Technical Decisions

- Use one Live2D model in `models/live2d` during development.
- Use WebSocket for desktop/server events.
- Use OpenAI-compatible API shape for the first LLM provider.
- Use SQLite for memory.
- Keep tool execution disabled by default except safe tools such as current time.
- Keep current desktop voice playback as a fallback, but move the audio interface into Python.

## Audio Layout

Current fallback voice output uses Electron/browser `speechSynthesis`, so available voices depend on Windows system voices.

The Python audio module owns the long-term audio interface. Local audio assets should live under:

```text
packages/amadeus/assets/audio/
  voices/
  sfx/
  cache/
```

- `voices/`: fixed character voice clips, such as greetings or short reactions. These do not provide arbitrary text speech.
- `sfx/`: UI and character sound effects.
- `cache/`: generated TTS output when a real TTS engine is added.

The desktop app should only play the `audioUrl` emitted by the runtime. If no Python TTS provider can generate audio for the requested text, the desktop falls back to `speechSynthesis`.

Fixed wav/mp3 files are useful for sound effects and canned reactions, but they are not a replacement for TTS. Arbitrary assistant replies require a provider such as GPT-SoVITS, Bert-VITS2, ChatTTS, Piper, OpenAI TTS, Azure Speech, or another engine behind `amadeus/audio.py`.

## GPT-SoVITS Test Setup

The first local TTS provider candidate is GPT-SoVITS:

```text
D:\OtherProject\LearningLLM\GPT-SoVITS
```

Vivian fine-tuned model assets currently live outside the app repo:

```text
D:\OtherProject\LearningLLM\dataset\薇薇安_zh
D:\OtherProject\LearningLLM\dataset\薇薇安_en
```

Each language has one GPT checkpoint, one SoVITS checkpoint, and one reference wav. These are not enough by themselves: GPT-SoVITS also needs pretrained base assets under `GPT_SoVITS/pretrained_models`, including BERT, HuBERT, and the matching base GPT/SoVITS weights for the configured version.

On this Windows machine, `pwsh` is not available. Use Windows PowerShell to run the installer:

```powershell
cd D:\OtherProject\LearningLLM\GPT-SoVITS
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1 -Device CU126 -Source ModelScope
```

After the base models are present, start the API:

```powershell
python api_v2.py -a 127.0.0.1 -p 9880 -c GPT_SoVITS/configs/tts_infer.yaml
```

The Amadeus provider should only be wired after standalone GPT-SoVITS tests can generate both Chinese and English wav files from the Vivian weights.

## Permission Model

Tools should use one of three permission levels:

- `allow`: safe to run immediately.
- `ask`: requires explicit user approval.
- `deny`: unavailable.

Examples:

- current time: `allow`
- reading selected local folders: `ask`
- deleting files: `deny` until a stronger approval UI exists

## Desktop Behavior States

The desktop character should react to runtime state:

- `idle`: default breathing/idle animation
- `listening`: attentive expression
- `thinking`: focused expression or thinking motion
- `speaking`: talking motion and lipsync
- `tool-running`: focused/working state
- `error`: confused expression, then return to idle
